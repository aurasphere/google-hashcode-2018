# Google HashCode 2018

This repository contains my solution to the Google HashCode 2018 Qualification round problem. The solution is a simple greedy algorithm written in Java.

## Score
The score has been validated by using [this Python script not written by me](https://github.com/PicoJr/2018-hashcode-score):

 - *a_example.in*: 4 points
 - *b_should_be_easy.in*: 176.677 points
 - *c_no_hurry.in*: 13.789.773 points
 - *d_metropolis.in*: 10.914.293 points
 - *e_high_bonus.in*: 21.460.945 points
 - **Total**: 46.341.692 points

For reference, if this was in the competition it would have been #604 worldwide and #34 in Italy. The first placed score is only 3 millions points ahead.
